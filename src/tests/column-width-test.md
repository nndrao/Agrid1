# Manual Test for Column Width Preservation

## Test Steps

1. Open the application and observe the AG-Grid
2. Adjust the width of several columns by dragging their edges
3. Click the "Save Profile" button
4. Observe that:
   - The column widths remain unchanged
   - The grid does not refresh/flicker
   - The columns do not revert to their original widths

5. Refresh the page
6. Observe that:
   - The column widths are restored to the saved values

## Expected Results

- When saving a profile, the column widths should be preserved
- The grid should not refresh or flicker
- The columns should not revert to their original widths
- After refreshing the page, the column widths should be restored to the saved values

## Console Logs to Check

- You should see "Preserving column widths after profile save" in the console
- You should see "Column widths preserved successfully" in the console
- You should see "Profile saved successfully without full grid refresh" in the console
